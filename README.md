# BMI-Calculator
 BMI calculator project using REACT
 BMI stands for Body Mass Index, a statistic that takes a person's Height and Weight as a way to dictate if they are under/overweight. Since it doesn't take into account other important factors such as age, musclemass, etc it cannot be used as definite way of describing someone's health so take it with a graing of salt.
